# Selection Sort Algorithm in Python

This repository contains a Python implementation of the selection sort algorithm, along with test cases and comments for clarity.

## Selection Sort

Selection sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the array and swapping it with the element at the beginning of the unsorted portion. The sorted portion of the array grows with each iteration.

## Getting Started

To use the selection sort implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/selection-sort-python.git`
2. Navigate to the repository directory: `cd selection-sort-python`
3. Run the script: `python selection_sort.py`

The script includes test cases demonstrating sorting various types of arrays.

## Code Explanation

The `selection_sort` function in `selection_sort.py` takes an input list and returns the sorted list using the selection sort algorithm. It includes error handling for inappropriate input.

## Test Cases

The script includes the following test cases:

1. Positive integers
2. Negative integers
3. Mixed positive and negative integers
4. Floats
5. Empty array

Feel free to modify the test cases to suit your needs.
