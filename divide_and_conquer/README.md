# Divide and Conquer Algorithm

This Python code demonstrates a simple divide-and-conquer algorithm to find the maximum element in an array. This README section provides a detailed explanation of how the recursive calls work and what happens in memory as the algorithm is executed.

## How the Recursive Calls Work

The `divide_and_conquer_max` function employs a recursive divide-and-conquer strategy to find the maximum element in an array. Here's a step-by-step explanation of what happens during the recursive calls:

1. **Base Case**: The recursion starts with a base case. If the input array has only one element, the function returns that element as the maximum.

2. **Dividing the Problem**: If the array has more than one element, it's divided into two halves. The midpoint of the array is calculated, and the array is split into `left_half` and `right_half`.

3. **Recursion**: Recursive calls are made for both `left_half` and `right_half`. These calls continue until each subarray reaches the base case, where they each have only one element. The maximum element is found for each subarray during this process.

4. **Combining Results**: The maximum of the results from the recursive calls for `left_half` and `right_half` is determined, and this value is returned as the maximum for the original array.

5. **Backtracking**: The recursion backtracks as each subproblem is solved, and the maximum value "bubbles up" from the base cases to the original problem, ultimately giving us the maximum element in the entire array.

This recursive process effectively breaks down the problem into smaller parts, solves each part independently, and then combines the solutions to solve the original problem.

## Usage
